# web3-test
Learn web3 with Python


# Setup

Get an account with [Infura](https://infura.io)
Get a wallet with [MetaMask](https://metamask.io)
Get some testnet ETH for the [Sepolia](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networks/#sepolia) testnet.

Configure your infura project to use API key secret and then store the key and its secret as environment variables:

- INFURA_API_KEY 
- INFURA_API_KEY_SECRET

The code reads these env variables to generate a basic authentication token.
